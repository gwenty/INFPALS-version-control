# INFPALS-version-control

Welcome to our workshop on using github! 

Start with Basic Git Commands to get familiar with the basics. When you feel comfortable with this, move on to Branching, Merging and Rebasing.

We will be working in pairs. (Read more at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) This way, one person can do the coding while the other reviews and keeps closer track of the instructions. We will let you know when to switch roles.
